Teradek RT Reversed Rings - Metric System

Simply adjust the printer to make the strip 26cm long and align to the hand unit from the infinity mark. 

You need to make sure the strips of the rings have 26,0cm - be precise. Just past the PNG image in a Google Docs page, try and print a few times adjusting the size. 

If things do not match in your HU, you want to make like your own, feel free to adjust the marks int the psd and hires files.
